            Flooding can strike at any moment. It is the most frequently
            occurring natural disaster around the world and is increasing in
            frequency year on year.

              The Arete Flood Barrier can be deployed on almost any surface;
              grass, asphalt, tile, stone floorings, sand etc.

                of the water is pushing to the skirt and the skirt is holding

              Arete are able to assist in the best way to plan and decide where
              and how to protect an area from flooding in the best possible way.
              Deployment of effective flood protection depends on the type of
              flood. A flash flood will differ from that of a flood which
              inundates the lower part of an alluvial river or a flood as a
              result of extreme precipitation.

            <h3>APPLICATION</h3>
            <br />

            <p>
              Construction is made as a single unit and can be produced from 20
              up to 200 meters long. The Bottom ballast tubes are filled with
              water, and the top tube can be filled with water or air, which
              should be decided based on the weather and natural conditions.
              Connections between segments have an aluminium or stainless steel
              single dispense system using fast camlock couplings. During
              installation a special sock will cover all connection points and
              will provide protection against any leakages.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - PUR/PVC alloy, 1360g. per meter, will provide extra durability.
              This material has excellent UV resistance as well as strong
              mechanical and resistance to any other possible damages.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - The Construction on the external side has an antispp surface to
              avoid installed barriers from moving.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - All along the segment, on both sides are welded reflective
              stripes. On each connection there is a place to put an emergency
              pght.
            </p>
            <br />
            <blockquote>
              The Arete Flood PRO has a unique design where the outer layer can
              be pierced but the inner layer remins in tact and effective.
            </blockquote>
            <br />
            <p>
              - All welding places are made by High Frequency welding
              technology, which makes construction very strong and durable
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - Can be filled from a single point, but water/air inflation
              valves are installed every 100 meters or at least in two places on
              each segment.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              - Discharge valves are made with possibipty to connect a pump to
              suck the water out to enable the barrier to be recovered faster.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - All valves are equipped with ball-type plugs and fast connectors
              (Camlock, Storz, Gost or simipar).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - To deploy a barrier you need: set of hoses; water pump and air
              blower. No additional elements are needed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - No special knowledge or skills are needed for deployment.
              Process is basic and fast and a quick start guide is provided.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              - Arete flood barriers are specially designed to make depvery to
              site very easy. Dry width is 220cm. Barriers can be stored and
              forwarded in a 40' ISO container or in containers with Hookpft
              systems. Up to 1500 meters of barrier fits into a container.
              Hydraupc winders/reels is one of the reccommended options for
              deployment and recovery. Size of winder/reel with 200m of Flood
              PRO barrier is W240cm x H250cm x L250cm. Weight of this set is
              ~1800kg. Six winders/reels can be forwarded using standard truck
              with 13,5 meters trailer.
